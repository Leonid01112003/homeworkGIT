            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <small>Chapter 1</small>
            <p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setupbr <br>
             instructions, they've moved to their own section. Continue reading for an introduction to the  <br>
             documentation, Native Components, React, and more!</p>
            <h2>core components</h2>
            <small>Chapter 2</small>
            <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React 
                and   <br> the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs <br>
                 APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: bundles<br> 
                 of reusable, nestable code. You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover  <br>
                how components work in React Native.</p>
            <h2>react fundamentals</h2>
            <small>Chapter 3</small>
            <div class="text">
                <p>React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with    <br>
                    JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get<br>
                     you started or can serve as a refresher course.
                   </p>
                   <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                   <p>+ components. The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,<br>
                   approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>
                   <p>+ JSX. React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so: <br>   
                   <Text> ; Hello, I am your cat!</Text>.</p>
                   <p>The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is <br>
                    JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat, name, and <br>
                     embedding it with curly braces inside <Text></Text></p>
                   <p>+ props. Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. </p>
            </div>
            
            <p>+ state. While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render,<br>
                 state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over <br>
                  time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!</p>
            <h2>handling text input</h2>
            <small>Chapter 4</small>
            <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an onChangeText prop that <br>
                takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a  <br>
                function to be called when the text is submitted.</p>
            <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language. <br>
                 In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there <br>
                  Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
